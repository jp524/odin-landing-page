# Oding Landing Page

Built as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum.

This is a static landing page created using HTML and CSS.

Flexbox is used for styling the different elements. The content of the page is adjusted as the width of the page changes.

The page is composed of the following sections:
* Header with links
* Hero section
* Information section
* Quote section
* Call to action section featuring a modal
* Footer

## Improvement Ideas

* Change the size of the image of the hero section based on the size of the page

* Refactor style.css to apply properties to multiples classes in one line
